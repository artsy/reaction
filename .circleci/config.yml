    steps:
      # Note that the deploy job doesn't call install_dependencies. It's this
      # way for two reasons:
      #   1) It waits for the update-cache job to run so it's guarenteed that
      #      the cache will contain the packages needed for this deployment
      #      process. (i.e. there's not reason to run yarn install)
      #   2) When npm/yarn install runs it executes the pre and post install
      #      hooks of dependencies which means child packages could read any
      #      environment variables available. While this doesn't 100% protect
      #      us, it does reduce that attack surface. Note that this job is the
      #      _only_ job with the environment variables needed to publish thanks
      #      to the context being specified in the workflow.
